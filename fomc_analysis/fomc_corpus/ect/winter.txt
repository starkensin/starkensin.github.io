Release
Date:
January
26,
2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
confirms
that
the
economic
recovery
is
continuing,
though
at
a
rate
that
has
been
insufficient
to
bring
about
a
significant
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
Growth
in
household
spending
picked
up
late
last
year,
but
remains
constrained
by
high
unemployment,
modest
income
growth,
lower
housing
wealth,
and
tight
credit.
Business
spending
on
equipment
and
software
is
rising,
while
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak.
Employers
remain
reluctant
to
add
to
payrolls.
The
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Although
commodity
prices
have
risen,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
have
been
trending
downward.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Currently,
the
unemployment
rate
is
elevated,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
are
somewhat
low,
relative
to
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent,
over
the
longer
run,
with
its
dual
mandate.
Although
the
Committee
anticipates
a
gradual
return
to
higher
levels
of
resource
utilization
in
a
context
of
price
stability,
progress
toward
its
objectives
has
been
disappointingly
slow.
To
promote
a
stronger
pace
of
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
continue
expanding
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
November.
In
particular,
the
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings
and
intends
to
purchase
$600
billion
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
by
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
of
2011.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
pace
of
its
securities
purchases
and
the
overall
size
of
the
asset-purchase
program
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
will
adjust
the
program
as
needed
to
best
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
will
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions,
including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization,
subdued
inflation
trends,
and
stable
inflation
expectations,
are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period.
The
Committee
will
continue
to
monitor
the
economic
outlook
and
financial
developments
and
will
employ
its
policy
tools
as
necessary
to
support
the
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate.

Release
Date:

2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
November
suggests
that
the
economy
has
been
expanding
moderately,
notwithstanding
some
apparent
slowing
in
global
growth.
While
indicators
point
to
some
improvement
in
overall
labor
market
conditions,
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
has
continued
to
advance,
but
business
fixed
investment
appears
to
be
increasing
less
rapidly
and
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
Inflation
has
moderated
since
earlier
in
the
year,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
continues
to
expect
a
moderate
pace
of
economic
growth
over
coming
quarters
and
consequently
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Strains
in
global
financial
markets
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
will
settle,
over
coming
quarters,
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee¡¯s
dual
mandate.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
the
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
continue
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
September.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policies
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
The
Committee
also
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
mid-2013.
The
Committee
will
continue
to
assess
the
economic
outlook
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
is
prepared
to
employ
its
tools
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
in
a
context
of
price
stability.

at
this
time.

Inflation
has

in
recent
months,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent

the

for
monetary
policy.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the

who
preferred
to
omit
the
description
of
the
time
period

Release
Date:
December
12,
2012
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic
activity
and
employment
have
continued
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
in
recent
months,
apart
from
weather-related
disruptions.
Although
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
somewhat
since
the
summer,
it
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
has
continued
to
advance,
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
further
signs
of
improvement,
but
growth
in
business
fixed
investment
has
slowed.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee¡¯s
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect
fluctuations
in
energy
prices.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
remains
concerned
that,
without
sufficient
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
might
not
be
strong
enough
to
generate
sustained
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
Furthermore,
strains
in
global
financial
markets
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
will
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
also
will
purchase
longer-term
Treasury
securities
after
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
Treasury
securities
is
completed
at
the
end
of
the
year,
initially
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and,
in
January,
will
resume
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
If
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
does
not
improve
substantially,
the
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
such
improvement
is
achieved
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
as
always,
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee¡¯s
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
The
Committee
views
these
thresholds
as
consistent
with
its
earlier
date-based
guidance.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
growth
in
economic
activity
paused
in
recent
months,
in
large
part
because
of
weather-related
disruptions
and
other
transitory
factors.
Employment
has
continued
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
further
improvement.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee¡¯s
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect
fluctuations
in
energy
prices.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Although
strains
in
global
financial
markets
have
eased
somewhat,
the
Committee
continues
to
see
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
will
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
If
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
does
not
improve
substantially,
the
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
such
improvement
is
achieved
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
as
always,
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee¡¯s
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
December

2013
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
indicates
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
further
improvement;
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
but
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
slowed
somewhat
in
recent
months.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
may
be
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
pick
up
from
its
recent
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
become
more
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
Taking
into
account
the
extent
of
federal
fiscal
retrenchment
since
the
inception
of
its
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
sees
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
over
that
period
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions,
the
Committee
decided
to
modestly
reduce
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
January,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$35
billion
per
month
rather
than
$40
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
rather
than
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
The
Committee
also
reaffirmed
its
expectation
that
the
current
exceptionally
low
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
of
0
to
1/4
percent
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
now
anticipates,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
well
past
the
time
that
the
unemployment
rate
declines
below
6-1/2
percent,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

changes
in
the
purchase
program
are
premature
until
incoming

more
clearly
indicate
that
economic
growth
is
likely
to
be
sustained
above
its

picked
up
in
recent
quarters.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment

declined

Household

Beginning
in

information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
The
Committee
also
reaffirmed
its
expectation
that
the
current
exceptionally
low
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
of
0
to
1/4
percent
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
well
past
the
time
that
the
unemployment
rate
declines
below
6-1/2
percent,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
December
17,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
improved
further,
with
solid
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
somewhat
further;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
Based
on
its
current
assessment,
the
Committee
judges
that
it
can
be
patient
in
beginning
to
normalize
the
stance
of
monetary
policy.
The
Committee
sees
this
guidance
as
consistent
with
its
previous
statement
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
following
the
end
of
its
asset
purchase
program
in
October,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
However,
if
incoming
information
indicates
faster
progress
toward
the
Committee's
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

who
believed

improvement
in
the
U.S.
economic
performance
since
October
has
moved
forward,
further
than
the
majority
of
the
Committee
envisions,
the
date
when
it
will
likely
be
appropriate
to
increase
the
federal

rate;
Narayana
Kocherlakota,
who
believed
that
the
Committee's
decision,
in
the
context
of
ongoing
low
inflation
and
falling
market-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations,
created
undue
downside
risk
to
the
credibility
of
the
2
percent
inflation
target;
and
Charles
I.
Plosser,
who
believed
that
the
statement
should
not
stress
the
importance
of
the
passage
of
time
as
a
key
element
of
its
forward
guidance
and,
given
the
improvement
in
economic
conditions,
should
not
emphasize
the
consistency
of
the
current
forward
guidance
with
previous
statements.
Release

2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
solid
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
recent
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committee¡¯s
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
substantially
in
recent
months;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects

with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent

The

continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
decline
further
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The

To

continued

the

Release
Date:
December
16,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
solid
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
ongoing
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment,
shows
further
improvement
and
confirms
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
appreciably
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
some
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
edged
down.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
continue
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Overall,
taking
into
account
domestic
and
international
developments,
the
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
both
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
balanced.
Inflation
is
expected
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
The
Committee
judges
that
there
has
been
considerable
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
this
year,
and
it
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
rise,
over
the
medium
term,
to
its
2
percent
objective.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
and
recognizing
the
time
it
takes
for
policy
actions
to
affect
future
economic
outcomes,
the
Committee
decided
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
to
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative
after
this
increase,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
labor
market
conditions
improved
further
even
as
economic
growth
slowed
late
last
year.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
moderate
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft
and
inventory
investment
slowed.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
some
additional
decline
in
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
declined
further;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
the
further
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
is
closely
monitoring
global
economic
and
financial
developments
and
is
assessing
their
implications
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation,
and
for
the
balance
of
risks
to
the
outlook.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into

a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will

For

2:00
p.m.
EST
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
November
indicates
that
the
labor
market
has
continued
to
strengthen
and
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace
since
mid-year.
Job
gains
have
been
solid
in
recent
months
and
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined.
Household
spending
has
been
rising
moderately
but
business
fixed
investment
has
remained
soft.
Inflation
has
increased
since
earlier
this
year
but
is
still
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
moved
up
considerably
but
still
are
low;
most
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory

the

adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
strengthen
somewhat
further.
Inflation
is
expected
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
past
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
Near-term
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
appear
roughly
balanced.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
In
view
of
realized
and
expected
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation,
the
Committee
decided
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
to
1/2
to
3/4
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
some
further
strengthening
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
