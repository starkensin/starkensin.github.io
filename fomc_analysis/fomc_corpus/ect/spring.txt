Release
Date:

2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
the
economic
recovery
is
on
a
firmer
footing,
and
overall
conditions
in
the
labor
market
appear
to
be
improving
gradually.
Household
spending
and
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continue
to
expand.
However,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Commodity
prices
have
risen
significantly
since
the
summer,
and
concerns
about
global
supplies
of
crude
oil
have
contributed
to
a
sharp
run-up
in
oil
prices
in
recent
weeks.
Nonetheless,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
have
been
subdued.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Currently,
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
continue
to
be
somewhat
low,
relative
to
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent,
over
the
longer
run,
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
recent
increases
in
the
prices
of
energy
and
other
commodities
are
currently
putting
upward
pressure
on
inflation.
The
Committee
expects
these
effects
to
be
transitory,
but
it
will
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate
a
gradual
return
to
higher
levels
of
resource
utilization
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
To
promote
a
stronger
pace
of
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
continue
expanding
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
November.
In
particular,
the
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings
and
intends
to
purchase
$600
billion
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
by
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
of
2011.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
pace
of
its
securities
purchases
and
the
overall
size
of
the
asset-purchase
program
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
will
adjust
the
program
as
needed
to
best
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
will
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions,
including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization,
subdued
inflation
trends,
and
stable
inflation
expectations,
are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period.
The
Committee
will
continue
to
monitor
the
economic
outlook
and
financial
developments
and
will
employ
its
policy
tools
as
necessary
to
support
the
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate.

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
the
economy
has
been
expanding
moderately.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further;
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
notably
in
recent
months
but
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
continued
to
advance.
The
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
Inflation
has
been
subdued
in
recent
months,
although
prices
of
crude
oil
and
gasoline
have
increased
lately.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
moderate
economic
growth
over
coming
quarters
and
consequently
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Strains
in
global
financial
markets
have
eased,
though
they
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
recent
increase
in
oil
and
gasoline
prices
will
push
up
inflation
temporarily,
but
the
Committee
anticipates
that
subsequently
inflation
will
run
at
or
below
the
rate
that
it
judges
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
expects
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
for
monetary
policy.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
late
2014.
The
Committee
also
decided
to
continue
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
September.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policies
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and

of
its

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
a
return
to
moderate
economic
growth
following
a
pause
late
last
year.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
signs
of
improvement
in
recent
months
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
strengthened
further,
but
fiscal
policy
has
become
somewhat
more
restrictive.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect
fluctuations
in
energy
prices.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a

economic
recovery

to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
The
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases
as
well
as
the
extent
of
progress
toward
its
economic
objectives.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a

percent.

Release
Date:
May
1,
2013
(April)
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
some
improvement
in
recent
months,
on
balance,
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
strengthened
further,
but
fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect
fluctuations
in
energy
prices.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing

and
of

Taken
together,
these

should
maintain
downward

on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and

The

of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,

employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
The
Committee
is
prepared
to
increase
or
reduce
the
pace
of
its
purchases
to
maintain
appropriate
policy
accommodation
as
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
or
inflation
changes.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
take
appropriate

likely
efficacy
and

Release
Date:
March
19,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
adverse
weather
conditions.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
however,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
continued
to
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
April,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$25
billion
per
month
rather
than
$30
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$30
billion
per
month
rather
than
$35
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.
With
the
unemployment
rate
nearing
6-1/2
percent,
the
Committee
has
updated
its
forward
guidance.
The
change
in
the
Committee's
guidance
does
not
indicate
any
change
in
the
Committee's
policy
intentions
as
set
forth
in
its
recent
statements.

the
credibility
of
the
Committee's
commitment
to
return

percent

and
fosters
policy
uncertainty
that
hinders
economic
activity.
Release
Date:
April
30,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
has
picked
up
recently,
after
having
slowed
sharply
during
the
winter
in
part
because
of
adverse
weather
conditions.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
however,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
more
quickly.
Business
fixed
investment
edged
down,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
May,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$20
billion
per
month
rather
than
$25
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$25
billion
per
month
rather
than
$30
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
March
18,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
growth
has
moderated
somewhat.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow
and
export
growth
has
weakened.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
energy
price
declines
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
Consistent
with
its
previous
statement,
the
Committee
judges
that
an
increase
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
unlikely
at
the
April
FOMC
meeting.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
This
change
in
the
forward
guidance
does
not
indicate
that
the
Committee
has
decided
on
the
timing
of
the
initial
increase
in
the
target
range.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as

Release
Date:
April

2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
suggests
that
economic
growth
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
transitory
factors.
The
pace
of
job
gains
moderated,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
was
little
changed.
Growth
in
household
spending
declined;
households'
real
incomes
rose
strongly,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Business
fixed
investment
softened,
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow,
and
exports
declined.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Although
growth
in
output
and
employment
slowed
during
the
first
quarter,
the
Committee
continues
to
expect
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing

Inflation

in
the
near

but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues

monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace
despite
the
global
economic
and
financial
developments
of
recent
months.
Household
spending
has
been
increasing
at
a
moderate
rate,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
picked
up
in
recent
months;
however,
it
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
However,
global
economic
and
financial
developments
continue
to
pose
risks.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

the
FOMC
monetary
policy
action

L.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
indicates
that
labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further
even
as
growth
in
economic
activity
appears
to
have
slowed.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
moderated,
although
households'
real
income
has
risen
at
a
solid
rate
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Since
the
beginning
of
the
year,
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further
but
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
falling
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are

in
