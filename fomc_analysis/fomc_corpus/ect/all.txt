Release
Date:
January
26,
2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
confirms
that
the
economic
recovery
is
continuing,
though
at
a
rate
that
has
been
insufficient
to
bring
about
a
significant
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
Growth
in
household
spending
picked
up
late
last
year,
but
remains
constrained
by
high
unemployment,
modest
income
growth,
lower
housing
wealth,
and
tight
credit.
Business
spending
on
equipment
and
software
is
rising,
while
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak.
Employers
remain
reluctant
to
add
to
payrolls.
The
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Although
commodity
prices
have
risen,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
have
been
trending
downward.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Currently,
the
unemployment
rate
is
elevated,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
are
somewhat
low,
relative
to
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent,
over
the
longer
run,
with
its
dual
mandate.
Although
the
Committee
anticipates
a
gradual
return
to
higher
levels
of
resource
utilization
in
a
context
of
price
stability,
progress
toward
its
objectives
has
been
disappointingly
slow.
To
promote
a
stronger
pace
of
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
continue
expanding
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
November.
In
particular,
the
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings
and
intends
to
purchase
$600
billion
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
by
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
of
2011.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
pace
of
its
securities
purchases
and
the
overall
size
of
the
asset-purchase
program
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
will
adjust
the
program
as
needed
to
best
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
will
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions,
including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization,
subdued
inflation
trends,
and
stable
inflation
expectations,
are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period.
The
Committee
will
continue
to
monitor
the
economic
outlook
and
financial
developments
and
will
employ
its
policy
tools
as
necessary
to
support
the
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate.

Release
Date:

2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
the
economic
recovery
is
on
a
firmer
footing,
and
overall
conditions
in
the
labor
market
appear
to
be
improving
gradually.
Household
spending
and
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continue
to
expand.
However,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Commodity
prices
have
risen
significantly
since
the
summer,
and
concerns
about
global
supplies
of
crude
oil
have
contributed
to
a
sharp
run-up
in
oil
prices
in
recent
weeks.
Nonetheless,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable,
and
measures
of
underlying
inflation
have
been
subdued.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and

stability.
Currently,

levels
that
the
Committee
judges

over

with
its
dual
mandate.
The
recent
increases
in
the
prices
of
energy
and
other
commodities
are
currently
putting
upward
pressure
on
inflation.
The
Committee
expects
these
effects
to
be
transitory,
but
it
will
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate
a
gradual
return
to
higher
levels
of
resource
utilization
in
a

Release
Date:

2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
the
economic
recovery
is
continuing
at
a
moderate
pace,
though
somewhat
more
slowly
than
the
Committee
had
expected.
Also,
recent
labor
market
indicators
have
been
weaker
than
anticipated.
The
slower
pace
of
the
recovery
reflects
in
part
factors
that
are
likely
to
be
temporary,
including
the
damping
effect
of
higher
food
and
energy
prices
on
consumer
purchasing
power
and
spending
as
well
as
supply
chain
disruptions
associated
with
the
tragic
events
in
Japan.
Household
spending
and
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continue
to
expand.
However,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Inflation
has
picked
up
in
recent

mainly
reflecting
higher
prices
for
some
commodities
and
imported
goods,
as
well
as
the
recent
supply
chain
disruptions.
However,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated;
however,
the
Committee
expects
the
pace
of
recovery
to
pick
up
over
coming
quarters
and
the
unemployment
rate
to
resume
its
gradual
decline
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Inflation
has
moved
up
recently,
but
the
Committee
anticipates
that
inflation
will
subside
to
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
promote
the
ongoing
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period.
The
Committee
will
complete
its
purchases
of
$600
billion
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
by
the
end
of
this
month
and
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and

of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
The

Release
Date:
August

2011
(July)
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
economic
growth
so
far
this
year
has
been
considerably
slower
than
the
Committee
had
expected.
Indicators
suggest
a
deterioration
in
overall
labor
market
conditions
in
recent
months,
and
the
unemployment
rate
has
moved
up.
Household
spending
has
flattened
out,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
However,
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continues
to
expand.
Temporary
factors,
including
the
damping
effect
of
higher
food
and
energy
prices
on
consumer
purchasing
power
and
spending
as
well
as
supply
chain
disruptions
associated
with
the
tragic
events
in
Japan,
appear
to
account
for
only
some
of
the
recent
weakness
in
economic
activity.
Inflation
picked
up
earlier
in
the
year,
mainly
reflecting
higher
prices
for
some
commodities
and
imported
goods,
as
well
as
the
supply
chain
disruptions.
More
recently,
inflation
has
moderated
as
prices
of
energy
and
some
commodities
have
declined
from
their
earlier
peaks.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
now
expects
a
somewhat
slower
pace
of
recovery
over
coming
quarters
than
it
did
at
the
time
of
the
previous
meeting
and
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Moreover,
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
have
increased.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
will
settle,
over
coming
quarters,
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate
further.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
promote
the
ongoing
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
mid-2013.
The
Committee
also
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
The
Committee
discussed
the
range
of
policy
tools
available
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
It
will
continue
to
assess
the
economic
outlook
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
is
prepared
to
employ
these
tools
as
appropriate.

Release
Date:
September

2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
August
indicates
that
economic
growth
remains
slow.
Recent
indicators
point
to
continuing
weakness
in
overall
labor
market
conditions,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
has
been
increasing
at
only
a
modest
pace
in
recent
months
despite
some
recovery
in
sales
of
motor
vehicles
as
supply-chain
disruptions
eased.
Investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
However,
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continues
to
expand.
Inflation
appears
to
have
moderated
since
earlier
in
the
year
as
prices
of
energy
and
some
commodities
have
declined
from
their
peaks.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
continues
to
expect
some
pickup
in
the
pace
of
recovery
over
coming
quarters
but
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Moreover,
there
are
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook,
including
strains
in
global
financial
markets.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
will
settle,
over
coming
quarters,
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate
further.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
the
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities.
The
Committee
intends
to
purchase,
by
the
end
of
June
2012,
$400
billion
of
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
6
years
to
30
years
and
to
sell
an
equal
amount
of
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
3
years
or
less.
This
program
should
put
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates
and
help
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
To
help
support
conditions
in
mortgage
markets,
the
Committee
will
now
reinvest
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities.
In
addition,
the
Committee
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee
also
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
indicates
that
economic
growth
strengthened
somewhat
in
the
third
quarter,
reflecting
in
part
a
reversal
of
the
temporary
factors
that
had
weighed
on
growth
earlier
in
the
year.
Nonetheless,
recent
indicators
point
to
continuing
weakness
in
overall
labor
market
conditions,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending

over
coming
quarters,
inflation
will
run
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
To
support
a
stronger

and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels

the
Committee
expects
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
for
monetary
policy.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal

rate
at
least
through
late
2014.
The
Committee
also
decided
to
continue
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
September.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policies
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those

as
appropriate
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
in
a

of
price
stability.

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
the
economy
has
been
expanding
moderately.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further;
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
notably
in
recent
months
but
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
continued
to
advance.
The
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
Inflation
has
been
subdued
in
recent
months,
although
prices
of
crude
oil
and
gasoline
have
increased
lately.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
moderate
economic
growth
over
coming
quarters
and
consequently
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Strains
in
global
financial
markets
have
eased,
though
they
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
recent
increase
in
oil
and
gasoline
prices
will
push
up
inflation
temporarily,
but
the
Committee
anticipates
that
subsequently
inflation
will
run
at
or
below
the
rate
that
it
judges
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the

Release
Date:
September

2012
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
August
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
continued
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
in
recent
months.
Growth
in
employment
has
been
slow,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
has
continued
to
advance,
but
growth
in
business
fixed
investment
appears
to
have
slowed.
The
housing
sector
has
shown
some
further
signs
of
improvement,
albeit
from
a
depressed
level.
Inflation
has
been
subdued,
although
the
prices
of
some
key
commodities
have
increased
recently.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
is
concerned
that,
without
further
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
might
not
be
strong
enough
to
generate
sustained
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
Furthermore,
strains
in
global
financial
markets
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
would
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
agreed
today
to
increase
policy
accommodation
by
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
also
will
continue
through
the
end
of
the
year
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities
as
announced
in
June,
and
it
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities.
These
actions,
which
together
will
increase
the
Committee¡¯s
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
by
about
$85
billion
each
month
through
the
end
of
the
year,
should
put
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
If
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
does
not
improve
substantially,
the
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
undertake
additional
asset
purchases,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate
until
such
improvement
is
achieved
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
as
always,
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
also
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
be
warranted
at
least
through
mid-2015.

Information

since
the
Federal
Open

Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic

and

have
continued
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
in
recent
months,
apart
from
weather-related
disruptions.
Although
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
somewhat
since
the
summer,
it
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
has
continued
to
advance,
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
further
signs
of
improvement,
but
growth
in
business
fixed

has
slowed.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee¡¯s
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect

The

also
will
purchase
longer-term
Treasury
securities
after
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its

is

at
the

of
the

initially
at
a

$45

The

is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal

from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency

in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and,
in
January,
will
resume
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial

accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor

in
coming

If
the

labor
market
does
not
improve
substantially,
the
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed

employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
such
improvement
is
achieved
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the

composition
of
its
asset

the

will,
as
always,
take

the

for
a
considerable
time
after

program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0

1/4

and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal

rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee¡¯s
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
The
Committee
views
these
thresholds
as
consistent
with
its
earlier
date-based
guidance.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the

will
also

additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Although
strains
in
global
financial
markets
have
eased
somewhat,
the
Committee
continues
to
see
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
will
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
If
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
does
not
improve
substantially,
the
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
such
improvement
is
achieved
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
as
always,
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee¡¯s
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
a
return
to
moderate
economic
growth
following
a
pause
late
last
year.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
signs
of
improvement
in
recent
months
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
strengthened
further,
but
fiscal
policy
has
become
somewhat
more
restrictive.
Inflation
has
been
running
somewhat
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
apart
from
temporary
variations
that
largely
reflect
fluctuations
in
energy
prices.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent

its

the

that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
downside
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
diminished
since
the
fall.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
The
Committee
will

its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed

employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
The
Committee
is
prepared
to
increase
or
reduce
the
pace
of
its
purchases
to
maintain
appropriate
policy
accommodation
as
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
or
inflation
changes.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases
as
well
as
the
extent
of
progress
toward
its
economic
objectives.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of

for
a
considerable
time

strengthens.
In

the

decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal

rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one

on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
suggests
that
economic
activity
expanded
at
a
modest
pace
during
the
first
half
of
the
year.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
further
improvement
in
recent
months,
on
balance,
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
been
strengthening,
but
mortgage
rates
have
risen
somewhat
and
fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Partly
reflecting
transitory
influences,
inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
pick
up
from
its
recent
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The

the

and
the

as

The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
but
it
anticipates
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help

that
inflation,
over

For
immediate

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
July
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Some
indicators
of
labor
market
conditions
have
shown
further
improvement
in
recent
months,
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household

advanced,
and
the

but
mortgage

have
risen
further
and
fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Apart
from
fluctuations
due
to
changes
in
energy
prices,
inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term

The
Committee
sees
the
downside
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
diminished,
on
net,
since
last
fall,
but
the
tightening
of
financial
conditions
observed
in
recent
months,
if
sustained,
could
slow
the
pace
of
improvement
in
the
economy
and
labor
market.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
but
it
anticipates
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
Taking
into
account
the
extent
of
federal
fiscal
retrenchment,
the
Committee
sees
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
since
it
began
its
asset
purchase
program
a
year
ago
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
However,
the
Committee
decided
to
await
more
evidence
that
progress
will
be
sustained
before
adjusting
the
pace
of
its
purchases.
Accordingly,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt

Taken

longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
judging
when
to
moderate
the
pace
of
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
at
its
coming
meetings,
assess
whether
incoming
information
continues
to
support
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective.
Asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
economic
outlook
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a

for
a

readings
on

When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to

policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
October
30,
2013
(November)
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
generally
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
continued
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace.
Indicators
of
labor
market
conditions
have
shown
some
further
improvement,
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Available
data
suggest
that
household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
slowed
somewhat
in
recent
months.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Apart
from
fluctuations
due
to
changes
in
energy
prices,
inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
pick
up
from
its
recent
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
downside
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
diminished,
on
net,
since
last
fall.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
but
it
anticipates
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
Taking
into
account
the
extent
of
federal
fiscal
retrenchment
over
the
past
year,
the
Committee
sees
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
since
it
began
its
asset
purchase
program
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
However,
the
Committee
decided
to
await
more
evidence
that
progress
will
be
sustained
before
adjusting
the
pace
of
its
purchases.
Accordingly,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
In
judging
when
to
moderate
the
pace
of
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will,
at
its
coming
meetings,
assess
whether
incoming
information
continues
to
support
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective.
Asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
economic
outlook
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
December

2013
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
indicates
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
further
improvement;
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined
but
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
slowed
somewhat
in
recent
months.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
may
be
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
pick
up
from
its
recent
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
become
more
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
Taking
into
account
the
extent
of
federal
fiscal
retrenchment
since
the
inception
of
its
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
sees
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
over
that
period
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions,
the
Committee
decided
to
modestly
reduce
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
January,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$35
billion
per
month
rather
than
$40
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
rather
than
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
The
Committee
also
reaffirmed
its
expectation
that
the
current
exceptionally
low
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
of
0
to
1/4
percent
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
now
anticipates,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
well
past
the
time
that
the
unemployment
rate
declines
below
6-1/2
percent,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

are
premature

more

be
sustained
above

Market
Committee
met
in
December
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
picked
up
in
recent
quarters.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate
declined

see
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
over
that
period
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
February,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$30
billion
per
month
rather
than
$35
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$35
billion
per
month
rather
than
$40
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
The
Committee
also
reaffirmed
its
expectation
that
the
current
exceptionally
low
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
of
0
to
1/4
percent
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
well
past
the
time
that
the
unemployment
rate
declines
below
6-1/2
percent,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
March
19,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
adverse
weather
conditions.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
however,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
continued
to
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
April,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$25
billion
per
month
rather
than
$30
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$30
billion
per
month
rather
than
$35
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.
With
the
unemployment
rate
nearing
6-1/2
percent,
the
Committee
has
updated
its
forward
guidance.
The
change
in
the
Committee's
guidance
does
not
indicate
any
change
in
the
Committee's
policy
intentions
as
set
forth
in
its
recent
statements.

who
supported

the
credibility
of
the
Committee's
commitment
to
return
inflation
to
the
2
percent
target
from
below
and
fosters
policy
uncertainty
that
hinders
economic
activity.

toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
June
18,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
has
rebounded
in
recent
months.
Labor
market
indicators
generally
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
though
lower,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
resumed
its
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
July,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$20
billion
per
month
rather
than
$25
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the

decides
to
begin
to

approach
consistent
with

even

economic

Release
Date:
July
30,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
rebounded
in
the
second
quarter.
Labor
market
conditions
improved,
with
the
unemployment
rate
declining
further.
However,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
there
remains
significant
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
moved
somewhat
closer
to
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
and
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
August,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$10
billion
per
month
rather
than
$15
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor

and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued

and

the

reaffirmed
its

if
projected

2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that

July
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
On
balance,
labor
market
conditions
improved
somewhat
further;
however,
the
unemployment
rate
is
little
changed
and
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
there
remains
significant
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
and
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat
since
early
this
year.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
October,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$5
billion
per
month
rather
than
$10
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$10
billion
per
month
rather
than
$15
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
end
its
current
program
of
asset
purchases
at
its
next
meeting.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Voting

President
Fisher
believed
that
the
continued
strengthening
of
the
real
economy,
improved
outlook
for
labor
utilization
and
for
general
price
stability,
and
continued
signs
of
financial
market
excess,
will
likely
warrant
an
earlier
reduction
in
monetary
accommodation
than
is
suggested
by
the
Committee's
stated
forward
guidance.
President
Plosser
objected
to
the
guidance
indicating
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
"a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,"
because
such
language
is
time
dependent
and
does
not
reflect
the
considerable
economic
progress
that
has
been
made
toward
the
Committee's
goals.
Release
Date:
October
29,
2014
(November)
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
improved
somewhat
further,
with
solid
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
is
gradually
diminishing.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
somewhat;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Although
inflation
in
the
near
term
will
likely
be
held
down
by
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors,
the
Committee
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat
since
early
this
year.
The
Committee
judges
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
since
the
inception
of
its
current
asset
purchase
program.
Moreover,
the
Committee
continues
to
see
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
progress
toward
maximum
employment
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
Accordingly,
the
Committee
decided
to
conclude
its
asset
purchase
program
this
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
anticipates,
based
on
its
current
assessment,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
following
the
end
of
its
asset
purchase
program
this
month,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
However,
if
incoming
information
indicates
faster
progress
toward
the
Committee's
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

the
recent
slide
in
market-based
measures

longer-term

the

should
commit
to
keeping
the

at

until

Release

Household

moderately
and
business
fixed

is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
somewhat
further;
survey-based

economic

will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent

The

sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal

In
determining
how

indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
Based
on
its
current
assessment,
the
Committee
judges
that
it
can
be
patient
in
beginning
to
normalize
the
stance
of
monetary
policy.
The
Committee
sees
this
guidance
as
consistent
with
its
previous
statement
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
following
the

especially
if
projected

faster
progress
toward
the
Committee's
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

falling
market-based

Release
Date:
January
28,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
solid
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
recent
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committee¡¯s
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
substantially
in
recent
months;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
decline
further
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
Based
on
its
current
assessment,
the
Committee
judges
that
it
can
be
patient
in
beginning
to
normalize
the
stance
of
monetary
policy.
However,
if
incoming
information
indicates
faster
progress
toward
the
Committee¡¯s
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency

Release
Date:
March
18,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
growth
has
moderated
somewhat.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow
and
export
growth
has
weakened.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
energy
price
declines
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum

and
2

inflation.

market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
Consistent
with
its
previous
statement,
the
Committee
judges
that
an
increase
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
unlikely
at
the
April
FOMC
meeting.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
This
change
in
the
forward
guidance
does
not
indicate
that
the
Committee
has
decided
on
the
timing
of
the
initial
increase
in
the
target
range.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency

of

This
policy,
by

Release
Date:
April
29,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
suggests
that
economic
growth
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
transitory
factors.
The
pace
of
job
gains
moderated,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
was
little
changed.
Growth
in
household
spending
declined;
households'
real
incomes
rose
strongly,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Business
fixed
investment
softened,
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow,
and
exports
declined.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Although
growth
in
output
and
employment
slowed
during
the
first
quarter,
the
Committee
continues
to
expect
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual

The

see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price

the

Release
Date:
June
17,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
moderately
after
having
changed
little
during
the
first
quarter.
The
pace
of
job
gains
picked
up
while
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
diminished
somewhat.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
been
moderate
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
some
improvement;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
stayed
soft.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports;
energy
prices
appear
to
have
stabilized.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
moderately
in
recent
months.
Growth
in
household

has
been

the

sector
has
shown
additional
improvement;
however,
business
fixed

The
labor
market
continued
to
improve,
with
solid
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
continued

For

Open

Committee
met
in
July
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
moderately,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been

The
labor
market
continued

the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price

Recent
global
economic
and
financial
developments
may
restrain
economic
activity
somewhat
and
are
likely
to
put
further
downward
pressure
on
inflation
in
the
near
term.
Nonetheless,
the
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate

at

medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
whether
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
at
its
next
meeting,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
some
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
December
16,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
solid
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
ongoing
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment,
shows
further
improvement
and
confirms
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
appreciably
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
some
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
edged
down.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
continue
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Overall,
taking
into
account
domestic
and
international
developments,
the
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
both
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
balanced.
Inflation
is
expected
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
The
Committee
judges
that
there
has
been
considerable
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
this
year,
and
it
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
rise,
over
the
medium
term,
to
its
2
percent
objective.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
and
recognizing
the
time
it
takes
for
policy
actions
to
affect
future
economic
outcomes,
the
Committee
decided
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
to
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative
after
this
increase,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and

mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at

and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
labor
market
conditions
improved
further
even
as
economic
growth
slowed
late
last
year.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
moderate
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft
and
inventory
investment
slowed.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
some
additional
decline
in
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
declined
further;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its

the

seeks
to

labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
the
further
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium

as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in

and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
is
closely
monitoring
global
economic
and
financial
developments
and
is
assessing
their
implications
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation,
and
for
the
balance
of
risks
to
the
outlook.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace
despite
the
global
economic
and
financial
developments
of
recent
months.
Household
spending
has
been
increasing
at
a
moderate
rate,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
picked
up
in
recent
months;
however,
it
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
However,
global
economic
and
financial
developments
continue
to
pose
risks.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The

accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and

inflation.
In

and
size

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
indicates
that
labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further
even
as
growth
in
economic
activity
appears
to
have
slowed.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
moderated,
although
households'
real
income
has
risen
at
a
solid
rate
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Since
the
beginning
of
the
year,
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further
but
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
falling
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well

This
policy,
by

following
weak
growth
in
May.
On

payrolls
and
other

point
to
some
increase
in

and
labor
market
conditions
will
strengthen
somewhat
further.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
past
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
Near-term
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
appear
roughly
balanced.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
Committee
judges
that
the
case
for
an
increase
in
the
federal
funds
rate
has
strengthened
but
decided,
for
the
time
being,
to
wait
for
further
evidence
of
continued
progress
toward
its
objectives.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
indicates
that
the
labor
market
has
continued
to
strengthen
and
growth
of
economic
activity
has
picked
up
from
the
modest
pace
seen
in
the
first
half
of
this
year.
Although
the
unemployment
rate
is
little
changed
in
recent
months,
job
gains
have
been
solid.
Household
spending
has
been
rising
moderately
but
business
fixed
investment
has
remained
soft.
Inflation
has
increased
somewhat
since
earlier
this
year
but
is
still
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
moved
up
but
remain
low;
most
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
strengthen
somewhat
further.
Inflation
is
expected
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
