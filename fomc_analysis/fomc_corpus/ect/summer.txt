Release
Date:
June
22,
2011
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
the
economic
recovery
is
continuing
at
a
moderate
pace,
though
somewhat
more
slowly
than
the
Committee
had
expected.
Also,
recent
labor
market
indicators
have
been
weaker
than
anticipated.
The
slower
pace
of
the
recovery
reflects
in
part
factors
that
are
likely
to
be
temporary,
including
the
damping
effect
of
higher
food
and
energy
prices
on
consumer
purchasing
power
and
spending
as
well
as
supply
chain
disruptions
associated
with
the
tragic
events
in
Japan.
Household
spending
and
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continue
to
expand.
However,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
continues
to
be
depressed.
Inflation
has
picked
up
in
recent
months,
mainly
reflecting
higher
prices
for
some
commodities
and
imported
goods,
as
well
as
the
recent
supply
chain
disruptions.
However,
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated;
however,
the
Committee
expects
the
pace
of
recovery
to
pick
up
over
coming
quarters
and
the
unemployment
rate
to
resume
its
gradual
decline
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Inflation
has
moved
up
recently,
but
the
Committee
anticipates
that
inflation
will
subside
to
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
promote
the
ongoing
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
an
extended
period.
The
Committee
will
complete
its
purchases
of
$600
billion
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
by
the
end
of
this
month
and
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
The
Committee
will
monitor
the
economic
outlook
and
financial
developments
and
will
act
as
needed
to
best
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.

Release
Date:
August
9,
2011
(July)
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
economic
growth
so
far
this
year
has
been
considerably
slower
than
the
Committee
had
expected.
Indicators
suggest
a
deterioration
in
overall
labor
market
conditions
in
recent
months,
and
the
unemployment
rate
has
moved
up.
Household
spending
has
flattened
out,
investment
in
nonresidential
structures
is
still
weak,
and
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
However,
business
investment
in
equipment
and
software
continues
to
expand.
Temporary
factors,
including
the
damping
effect
of
higher
food
and
energy
prices
on
consumer
purchasing
power
and
spending
as
well
as
supply
chain
disruptions
associated
with
the
tragic
events
in
Japan,
appear
to
account
for
only
some
of
the
recent
weakness
in
economic
activity.
Inflation
picked
up
earlier
in
the
year,
mainly
reflecting
higher
prices
for
some
commodities
and
imported
goods,
as
well
as
the
supply
chain
disruptions.
More
recently,
inflation
has
moderated
as
prices
of
energy
and
some
commodities
have
declined
from
their
earlier
peaks.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
now
expects
a
somewhat
slower
pace
of
recovery
over
coming
quarters
than
it
did
at
the
time
of
the
previous
meeting
and
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
gradually
toward
levels
that
the
Committee
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Moreover,
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
have
increased.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
will
settle,
over
coming
quarters,
at
levels
at
or
below
those
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate
as
the
effects
of
past
energy
and
other
commodity
price
increases
dissipate
further.
However,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
evolution
of
inflation
and
inflation
expectations.
To
promote
the
ongoing
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
levels
consistent
with
its
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that
economic
conditions--including
low
rates
of
resource
utilization
and
a
subdued
outlook
for
inflation
over
the
medium
run--are
likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
mid-2013.
The
Committee
also
will
maintain
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
securities
holdings.
The
Committee
will
regularly
review
the
size
and
composition
of
its
securities
holdings
and
is
prepared
to
adjust
those
holdings
as
appropriate.
The
Committee
discussed
the
range
of
policy
tools
available
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
It
will
continue
to
assess
the
economic
outlook
in
light
of
incoming
information
and
is
prepared
to
employ
these
tools
as
appropriate.

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
suggests
that
the
economy
has
been
expanding
moderately
this
year.
However,
growth
in
employment
has
slowed
in
recent
months,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Business
fixed
investment
has
continued
to
advance.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
at
a
somewhat
slower
pace
than
earlier
in
the
year.
Despite
some
signs
of
improvement,
the
housing
sector
remains
depressed.
Inflation
has
declined,
mainly
reflecting
lower
prices
of
crude
oil
and
gasoline,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
economic
growth
to
remain
moderate
over
coming
quarters
and
then
to
pick
up
very
gradually.
Consequently,
the
Committee
anticipates
that
the
unemployment
rate
will
decline
only
slowly
toward
levels
that
it
judges
to
be
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
Furthermore,
strains
in
global
financial
markets
continue
to
pose
significant
downside
risks
to
the
economic
outlook.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
will
run
at
or
below
the
rate
that
it
judges
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
expects
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
for
monetary
policy.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
today
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
economic

and
a

over

likely
to
warrant
exceptionally
low
levels
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
least
through
late
2014.
The
Committee
also
decided
to
continue
through
the
end
of
the
year
its
program
to
extend
the
average
maturity
of
its
holdings
of
securities.
Specifically,
the
Committee
intends
to
purchase
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
6
years
to
30
years
at
the
current
pace
and
to
sell
or
redeem
an
equal
amount
of
Treasury
securities
with
remaining
maturities
of
approximately
3
years
or
less.
This
continuation
of
the
maturity
extension
program
should
put
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities.
The
Committee
is
prepared
to
take
further
action
as
appropriate
to
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
sustained
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
in
a
context
of
price
stability.

further,
but
fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Partly
reflecting
transitory
influences,
inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
proceed
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
downside
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
diminished
since
the
fall.
The
Committee
also
anticipates
that
inflation
over
the
medium
term
likely
will
run
at
or
below
its
2
percent
objective.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate,
the
Committee
decided
to
continue
purchasing
additional
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$40
billion
per
month
and
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$45
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
Taken
together,
these
actions
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months.
The
Committee
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
The
Committee
is
prepared
to
increase
or
reduce
the
pace
of
its
purchases
to
maintain
appropriate
policy
accommodation
as
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
or
inflation
changes.
In
determining
the
size,
pace,
and
composition
of
its
asset
purchases,
the
Committee
will
continue
to
take
appropriate
account
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases
as
well
as
the
extent
of
progress
toward
its
economic
objectives.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
expects
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
In
particular,
the
Committee
decided
to
keep
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
0
to
1/4
percent
and
currently
anticipates
that
this
exceptionally
low
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release

2013
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
suggests
that
economic
activity
expanded
at
a
modest
pace
during
the
first
half
of
the
year.
Labor
market
conditions
have
shown
further
improvement
in
recent
months,
on
balance,
but
the
unemployment
rate
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced,
and
the
housing
sector
has
been
strengthening,
but
mortgage
rates
have
risen
somewhat
and
fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth.
Partly
reflecting
transitory
influences,
inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term

the
Committee
seeks

and

stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
growth
will
pick
up
from
its
recent
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The

sees
the

to
the

for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
diminished
since
the

The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
but
it
anticipates
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
To
support
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
to
help
ensure
that
inflation,
over

the

Release
Date:
June
18,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
has
rebounded
in
recent
months.
Labor
market
indicators
generally
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
though
lower,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
resumed
its
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
July,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$20
billion
per
month
rather
than
$25
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
July
30,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
rebounded
in
the
second
quarter.
Labor
market
conditions
improved,
with
the
unemployment
rate
declining
further.
However,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
there
remains
significant
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
moved
somewhat
closer
to
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
and
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
August,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$10
billion
per
month
rather
than
$15
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
June
17,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
moderately
after
having
changed
little
during
the
first
quarter.
The
pace
of
job
gains
picked
up
while
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
diminished
somewhat.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
been
moderate
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
some
improvement;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
stayed
soft.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports;
energy
prices
appear
to
have
stabilized.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.

will
take
into

a
wide
range
of
information,
including

of

indicators
of

pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and

financial
and

developments.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of

This

by
keeping
the

at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
economic

has

expanding
moderately
in
recent
months.
Growth
in
household

has
been

the

sector
has
shown
additional
improvement;
however,
business
fixed

and
net
exports
stayed
soft.
The
labor
market
continued
to
improve,
with
solid
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the

longer-run
objective,
partly

the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
the
pace
of
improvement
in
the
labor
market
has
slowed
while
growth
in
economic
activity
appears
to
have
picked
up.
Although
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined,
job
gains
have
diminished.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
strengthened.
Since
the
beginning
of
the
year,
the
housing
sector
has
continued
to
improve
and
the
drag
from
net
exports
appears
to
have
lessened,
but
business
fixed
investment
has
been
soft.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
declined;
most
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
past
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
the
labor
market
strengthened
and
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
rate.
Job
gains
were
strong
in
June
following
weak
growth
in
May.
On
balance,
payrolls
and
other
labor
market
indicators
point
to
some
increase
in
labor
utilization
in
recent
months.
Household
spending
has
been
growing
strongly
but
business
fixed
investment
has
been
soft.
Inflation
has
continued

Near-term
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
have
diminished.

indicators
