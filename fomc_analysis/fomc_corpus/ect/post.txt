Release
Date:
January
29,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
picked
up
in
recent
quarters.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate
declined
but
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
advanced
more
quickly
in
recent
months,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
slowed
somewhat.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
the
unemployment
rate
will
gradually
decline
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
having
become
more
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
Taking
into
account
the
extent
of
federal
fiscal
retrenchment
since
the
inception
of
its
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
continues
to
see
the
improvement
in
economic
activity
and
labor
market
conditions
over
that
period
as
consistent
with
growing
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
February,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$30
billion
per
month
rather
than
$35
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$35
billion
per
month
rather
than
$40
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
will
remain
appropriate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends
and
the
economic
recovery
strengthens.
The
Committee
also
reaffirmed
its
expectation
that
the
current
exceptionally
low
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
of
0
to
1/4
percent
will
be
appropriate
at
least
as
long
as
the
unemployment
rate
remains
above
6-1/2
percent,
inflation
between
one
and
two
years
ahead
is
projected
to
be
no
more
than
a
half
percentage
point
above
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
longer-term
inflation
expectations
continue
to
be
well
anchored.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy,
the
Committee
will
also
consider
other
information,
including
additional
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
well
past
the
time
that
the
unemployment
rate
declines
below
6-1/2
percent,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.

Release
Date:
March
19,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
adverse
weather
conditions.
Labor
market
indicators
were
mixed
but
on
balance
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
however,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
continued
to
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
April,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$25
billion
per
month
rather
than
$30
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$30
billion
per
month
rather
than
$35
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.
With
the
unemployment
rate
nearing
6-1/2
percent,
the
Committee
has
updated
its
forward
guidance.
The
change
in
the
Committee's
guidance
does
not
indicate
any
change
in
the
Committee's
policy
intentions
as
set
forth
in
its
recent
statements.

who
supported

the
credibility
of
the
Committee's
commitment
to
return
inflation
to
the
2
percent
target
from
below
and
fosters
policy
uncertainty
that
hinders
economic
activity.

measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
May,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$20
billion
per
month
rather
than
$25
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$25
billion
per
month
rather
than
$30
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
June
18,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
has
rebounded
in
recent
months.
Labor
market
indicators
generally
showed
further
improvement.
The
unemployment
rate,
though
lower,
remains
elevated.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
resumed
its
advance,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
but
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
continue
to
improve
gradually,
moving
toward
those
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
the
economy
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
recognizes
that
inflation
persistently
below
its
2
percent
objective
could
pose
risks
to
economic
performance,
and
it
is
monitoring
inflation
developments
carefully
for
evidence
that
inflation
will
move
back
toward
its
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
July,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$20
billion
per
month
rather
than
$25
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the
pace
of
asset
purchases
in
further
measured
steps
at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
July
30,
2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
growth
in
economic
activity
rebounded
in
the
second
quarter.
Labor
market
conditions
improved,
with
the
unemployment
rate
declining
further.
However,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
there
remains
significant
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
moved
somewhat
closer
to
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
and
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the

the

in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
August,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$10
billion
per
month
rather
than
$15
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$15
billion
per
month
rather
than
$20
billion
per
month.
The

The

still-increasing

support
mortgage

that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent

the
Committee's
dual

The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a

If
incoming

expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and

moving

the
Committee
will
likely
reduce
the

in
further
measured

at
future
meetings.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not

range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the

below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
September

2014
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
July
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
On
balance,
labor
market
conditions
improved
somewhat
further;
however,
the
unemployment
rate
is
little
changed
and
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
there
remains
significant
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Household
spending
appears
to
be
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Fiscal
policy
is
restraining
economic
growth,
although
the
extent
of
restraint
is
diminishing.
Inflation
has
been
running
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
and
inflation
moving
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
and
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat
since
early
this
year.
The
Committee
currently
judges
that
there
is
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions.
In
light
of
the
cumulative
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
the
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
labor
market
conditions
since
the
inception
of
the
current
asset
purchase
program,
the
Committee
decided
to
make
a
further
measured
reduction
in
the
pace
of
its
asset
purchases.
Beginning
in
October,
the
Committee
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
at
a
pace
of
$5
billion
per
month
rather
than
$10
billion
per
month,
and
will
add
to
its
holdings
of
longer-term
Treasury
securities
at
a
pace
of
$10
billion
per
month
rather
than
$15
billion
per
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
The
Committee's
sizable
and
still-increasing
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
should
maintain
downward
pressure
on
longer-term
interest
rates,
support
mortgage
markets,
and
help
to
make
broader
financial
conditions
more
accommodative,
which
in
turn
should
promote
a
stronger
economic
recovery
and
help
to
ensure
that
inflation,
over
time,
is
at
the
rate
most
consistent
with
the
Committee's
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
will
closely
monitor
incoming
information
on
economic
and
financial
developments
in
coming
months
and
will
continue
its
purchases
of
Treasury
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities,
and
employ
its
other
policy
tools
as
appropriate,
until
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
has
improved
substantially
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
If
incoming
information
broadly
supports
the
Committee's
expectation
of
ongoing
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
inflation
moving
back
toward
its
longer-run
objective,
the
Committee
will
end
its
current
program
of
asset
purchases
at
its
next
meeting.
However,
asset
purchases
are
not
on
a
preset
course,
and
the
Committee's
decisions
about
their
pace
will
remain
contingent
on
the
Committee's
outlook
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation
as
well
as
its
assessment
of
the
likely
efficacy
and
costs
of
such
purchases.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
a
highly
accommodative
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
The
Committee
continues
to
anticipate,
based
on
its
assessment
of
these
factors,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
current
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
asset
purchase
program
ends,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

the
real

improved
outlook
for
labor
utilization
and
for
general
price
stability,
and
continued
signs
of
financial
market
excess,
will
likely
warrant
an
earlier
reduction
in
monetary
accommodation
than
is
suggested
by
the
Committee's
stated
forward
guidance.
President

Release

(November)
For

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
improved
somewhat
further,
with
solid
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
is
gradually
diminishing.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately
and
business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
somewhat;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster

The
Committee

at

and
inflation
moving

levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its

mandate.
The
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Although
inflation
in
the
near
term
will
likely
be
held
down
by
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors,
the
Committee
judges
that
the
likelihood
of
inflation
running
persistently
below
2
percent
has
diminished
somewhat
since
early
this
year.
The
Committee
judges
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
improvement
in
the
outlook
for
the
labor
market
since
the
inception
of
its
current
asset
purchase
program.
Moreover,
the
Committee
continues
to
see
sufficient
underlying
strength
in
the
broader
economy
to
support
ongoing
progress
toward
maximum
employment
in
a
context
of
price
stability.
Accordingly,
the
Committee
decided
to
conclude
its
asset
purchase
program
this
month.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and

its

indicators
of

and

The
Committee
anticipates,
based
on
its
current
assessment,
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
following
the
end
of
its
asset
purchase
program
this
month,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
However,
if
incoming
information
indicates
faster
progress
toward
the
Committee's
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent

the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
The
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
developments.
Based
on
its
current
assessment,
the
Committee
judges
that
it
can
be
patient
in
beginning
to
normalize
the
stance
of
monetary
policy.
The
Committee
sees
this
guidance
as
consistent
with
its
previous
statement
that
it
likely
will
be
appropriate
to
maintain
the
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
for
a
considerable
time
following
the
end
of
its
asset
purchase
program
in
October,
especially
if
projected
inflation
continues
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
goal,
and
provided
that
longer-term
inflation
expectations
remain
well
anchored.
However,
if
incoming
information
indicates
faster
progress
toward
the
Committee's
employment
and
inflation
objectives
than
the
Committee
now
expects,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
are
likely
to
occur
sooner
than
currently
anticipated.
Conversely,
if
progress
proves
slower
than
expected,
then
increases
in
the
target
range
are
likely
to
occur
later
than
currently
anticipated.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
January
28,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
solid
pace.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
recent
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committees
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
have
declined
substantially
in
recent
months;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
decline
further
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
lower
energy
prices
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2

inflation.

pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.

on
its

the

Release
Date:
March
18,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
growth
has
moderated
somewhat.
Labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further,
with
strong
job
gains
and
a
lower
unemployment
rate.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
continues
to
diminish.
Household
spending
is
rising
moderately;
declines
in
energy
prices
have
boosted
household
purchasing
power.
Business
fixed
investment
is
advancing,
while
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remains
slow
and
export
growth
has
weakened.
Inflation
has
declined
further
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
largely
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
energy
price
declines
and
other
factors
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This

take
into

a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of

market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
Consistent
with
its
previous
statement,
the
Committee
judges
that
an
increase
in
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
unlikely
at
the
April
FOMC
meeting.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
This
change
in
the
forward
guidance
does
not
indicate
that
the
Committee
has
decided
on
the
timing
of
the
initial
increase
in
the
target
range.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
April
29,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
suggests
that
economic
growth
slowed
during
the
winter
months,
in
part
reflecting
transitory
factors.
The
pace
of
job
gains
moderated,
and
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
A
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
was
little
changed.
Growth
in
household
spending
declined;
households'
real
incomes
rose
strongly,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Business
fixed
investment
softened,
the
recovery
in
the
housing
sector
remained
slow,
and
exports
declined.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Although
growth
in
output
and
employment
slowed
during
the
first
quarter,
the
Committee
continues
to
expect
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.?

Release
Date:
June
17,
2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
April
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
moderately
after
having
changed
little
during
the
first
quarter.
The
pace
of
job
gains
picked
up
while
the
unemployment
rate
remained
steady.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
diminished
somewhat.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
been
moderate
and
the
housing
sector
has
shown
some
improvement;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
stayed
soft.
Inflation
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
decreasing
prices
of
non-energy
imports;
energy
prices
appear
to
have
stabilized.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term,
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds

remains
appropriate.
In
determining
how
long
to
maintain
this
target
range,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and

its
objectives
of
maximum

that

Release

For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
June
indicates
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
moderately
in
recent
months.
Growth
in
household

has
been

has
shown
additional

however,

The
labor

with
solid
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment.
On
balance,
a
range
of
labor
market
indicators
suggests
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
since
early
this

For

Information

the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
July
suggests
that
economic
activity
is
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
moderately,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft.
The
labor
market
continued
to

with
solid

Market-based

moved
lower;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
Recent
global
economic
and
financial
developments
may
restrain
economic
activity
somewhat
and
are
likely
to
put
further
downward
pressure
on
inflation
in
the
near
term.
Nonetheless,
the
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward

the

The

the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly

but
is
monitoring
developments
abroad.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its

level
in
the
near

the

toward
2
percent
over
the
medium

as
the
labor
market
improves

the

dissipate.
The

To

the

release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
September
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
solid
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft.
The
pace
of
job
gains
slowed
and
the
unemployment
rate
held
steady.
Nonetheless,
labor
market
indicators,
on
balance,
show
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
moved
slightly
lower;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
remained
stable.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
appropriate
policy
accommodation,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace,
with
labor
market
indicators
continuing
to
move
toward
levels
the
Committee
judges
consistent
with
its
dual
mandate.
The
Committee
continues
to
see
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
nearly
balanced
but
is
monitoring
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Inflation
is
anticipated
to
remain
near
its
recent
low
level
in
the
near
term
but
the
Committee
expects
inflation
to
rise
gradually
toward
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
labor
market
improves
further
and
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
To
support
continued
progress
toward
maximum
employment
and
price
stability,
the
Committee
today
reaffirmed
its
view
that
the
current
0
to
1/4
percent
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
remains
appropriate.
In
determining
whether
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
at
its
next
meeting,
the
Committee
will
assess
progress--both
realized
and
expected--toward
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
The
Committee
anticipates
that
it
will
be
appropriate
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
when
it
has
seen
some
further
improvement
in
the
labor
market
and
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
move
back
to
its
2
percent
objective
over
the
medium
term.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.
When
the
Committee
decides
to
begin
to
remove
policy
accommodation,
it
will
take
a
balanced
approach
consistent
with
its
longer-run
goals
of
maximum
employment
and
inflation
of
2
percent.
The
Committee
currently
anticipates
that,
even
after
employment
and
inflation
are
near
mandate-consistent
levels,
economic
conditions
may,
for
some
time,
warrant
keeping
the
target
federal
funds
rate
below
levels
the
Committee
views
as
normal
in
the
longer
run.

Release
Date:
December

2015
For
immediate
release
Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
October
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
solid
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
ongoing
job
gains
and
declining
unemployment,
shows
further
improvement
and
confirms
that
underutilization
of
labor
resources
has
diminished
appreciably
since
early
this
year.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
some
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
have
edged
down.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
continue
to
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Overall,
taking
into
account
domestic
and
international
developments,
the
Committee
sees
the
risks
to
the
outlook
for
both
economic
activity
and
the
labor
market
as
balanced.
Inflation
is
expected
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
The
Committee
judges
that
there
has
been
considerable
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
this
year,
and
it
is
reasonably
confident
that
inflation
will
rise,
over
the
medium
term,
to
its
2
percent
objective.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
and
recognizing
the
time
it
takes
for
policy
actions
to
affect
future
economic
outcomes,
the
Committee
decided
to
raise
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
to
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative
after
this
increase,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
December
suggests
that
labor
market
conditions
improved
further
even
as
economic
growth
slowed
late
last
year.
Household
spending
and
business
fixed
investment
have
been
increasing
at
moderate
rates
in
recent
months,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
net
exports
have
been

and
inventory
investment
slowed.
A
range
of
recent
labor
market
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
some
additional
decline
in
underutilization
of
labor
resources.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
declined
further;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum

economic
activity

expand
at
a
moderate

and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
the
further
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
is
closely
monitoring
global
economic
and
financial
developments
and
is
assessing
their
implications
for
the
labor
market
and
inflation,
and
for
the
balance
of
risks
to
the
outlook.
Given
the
economic
outlook,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range

the
federal

the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In

of
the
current

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
January
suggests
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace
despite
the
global
economic
and
financial
developments
of
recent
months.
Household
spending
has
been
increasing
at
a
moderate
rate,
and
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further;
however,
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
picked
up
in
recent
months;
however,
it
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
However,
global
economic
and
financial
developments
continue
to
pose
risks.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
monitor
inflation
developments
closely.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
March
indicates
that
labor
market
conditions
have
improved
further
even
as
growth
in
economic
activity
appears
to
have
slowed.
Growth
in
household
spending
has
moderated,
although
households'
real
income
has
risen
at
a
solid
rate
and
consumer
sentiment
remains
high.
Since
the
beginning
of
the
year,
the
housing
sector
has
improved
further
but
business
fixed
investment
and
net
exports
have
been
soft.
A
range
of
recent
indicators,
including
strong
job
gains,
points
to
additional
strengthening
of
the
labor
market.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
falling
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
currently
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
indicators
will
continue
to
strengthen.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the

thereby

and

and
size
of

the
target
range

the

the
pace

in
the

Although
the

in

following
weak
growth
in
May.
On

payrolls
and
other

point
to
some
increase
in

Information
received
since
the
Federal
Open
Market
Committee
met
in
July
indicates
that
the
labor
market
has
continued
to
strengthen
and
growth
of
economic
activity
has
picked
up
from
the
modest
pace
seen
in
the
first
half
of
this
year.
Although
the
unemployment
rate
is
little
changed
in
recent
months,
job
gains
have
been
solid,
on
average.
Household
spending
has
been
growing
strongly
but
business
fixed
investment
has
remained
soft.
Inflation
has
continued
to
run
below
the
Committee's
2
percent
longer-run
objective,
partly
reflecting
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices
and
in
prices
of
non-energy
imports.
Market-based
measures
of
inflation
compensation
remain
low;
most
survey-based
measures
of
longer-term
inflation
expectations
are
little
changed,
on
balance,
in
recent
months.
Consistent
with
its
statutory
mandate,
the
Committee
seeks
to
foster
maximum
employment
and
price
stability.
The
Committee
expects
that,
with
gradual
adjustments
in
the
stance
of
monetary
policy,
economic
activity
will
expand
at
a
moderate
pace
and
labor
market
conditions
will
strengthen
somewhat
further.
Inflation
is
expected
to
remain
low
in
the
near
term,
in
part
because
of
earlier
declines
in
energy
prices,
but
to
rise
to
2
percent
over
the
medium
term
as
the
transitory
effects
of
past
declines
in
energy
and
import
prices
dissipate
and
the
labor
market
strengthens
further.
Near-term
risks
to
the
economic
outlook
appear
roughly
balanced.
The
Committee
continues
to
closely
monitor
inflation
indicators
and
global
economic
and
financial
developments.
Against
this
backdrop,
the
Committee
decided
to
maintain
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate
at
1/4
to
1/2
percent.
The
Committee
judges
that
the
case
for
an
increase
in
the
federal
funds
rate
has
strengthened
but
decided,
for
the
time
being,
to
wait
for
further
evidence
of
continued
progress
toward
its
objectives.
The
stance
of
monetary
policy
remains
accommodative,
thereby
supporting
further
improvement
in
labor
market
conditions
and
a
return
to
2
percent
inflation.
In
determining
the
timing
and
size
of
future
adjustments
to
the
target
range
for
the
federal
funds
rate,
the
Committee
will
assess
realized
and
expected
economic
conditions
relative
to
its
objectives
of
maximum
employment
and
2
percent
inflation.
This
assessment
will
take
into
account
a
wide
range
of
information,
including
measures
of
labor
market
conditions,
indicators
of
inflation
pressures
and
inflation
expectations,
and
readings
on
financial
and
international
developments.
In
light
of
the
current
shortfall
of
inflation
from
2
percent,
the
Committee
will
carefully
monitor
actual
and
expected
progress
toward
its
inflation
goal.
The
Committee
expects
that
economic
conditions
will
evolve
in
a
manner
that
will
warrant
only
gradual
increases
in
the
federal
funds
rate;
the
federal
funds
rate
is
likely
to
remain,
for
some
time,
below
levels
that
are
expected
to
prevail
in
the
longer
run.
However,
the
actual
path
of
the
federal
funds
rate
will
depend
on
the
economic
outlook
as
informed
by
incoming
data.
The
Committee
is
maintaining
its
existing
policy
of
reinvesting
principal
payments
from
its
holdings
of
agency
debt
and
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
in
agency
mortgage-backed
securities
and
of
rolling
over
maturing
Treasury
securities
at
auction,
and
it
anticipates
doing
so
until
normalization
of
the
level
of
the
federal
funds
rate
is
well
under
way.
This
policy,
by
keeping
the
Committee's
holdings
of
longer-term
securities
at
sizable
levels,
should
help
maintain
accommodative
financial
conditions.

Information

Open
Market
Committee
met
in
November
indicates
that
the
labor
market
has
continued
to
strengthen
and
that
economic
activity
has
been
expanding
at
a
moderate
pace
since
mid-year.
Job
gains
have
been

and
the
unemployment
rate
has
declined.
Household

Inflation
